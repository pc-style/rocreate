# Top 5 (features users most often look for when they want “Procreate-like”)
1.	Automatic, built-in time-lapse recording + export
2.	Gesture-first workflow (2-finger undo/redo, customizable gestures) + QuickMenu radial shortcut menu
3.	Deep brush engine (Brush Studio: build/tune brushes heavily)
4.	QuickShape + Drawing Assist (instant clean shapes + assisted guides)
5.	Stroke stabilization (StreamLine / global stabilization for smooth lines)

# 20 more (6–25)
6.	ColorDrop fill with threshold control (paint-bucket workflow)
7.	Reference Layer for cleaner lineart-based fills
8.	Reference Companion (floating canvas/image reference; includes FacePaint mode)
9.	Page Assist (multi-page “sketchbook” + PDF page flip/markup workflow)
10.	Animation Assist (timeline + onion-skin + playback)
11.	3D model painting (paint directly on imported 3D models)
12.	Layer Select (tap content to surface the correct layer(s))
13.	Multi-layer select + bulk transform/grouping (primary/secondary selection)
14.	Layer masks + Alpha Lock-style “paint within pixels” control
15.	Color Harmony picker (auto complementary/triadic/etc schemes)
16.	Gradient Map adjustment (quick stylized recoloring via gradients)  ￼
17.	Recolor with live preview (QuickMenu-driven recoloring)  ￼
18.	Automatic selection (tap-to-select regions by color)  ￼
19.	Warp mesh transform  ￼
20.	Distort transform (fast perspective/tilt effects)  ￼
21.	Liquify as a brush (multi-mode pixel warping)  ￼
22.	Symmetry guides (mirrored/radial drawing)  ￼
23.	Accessibility-first smoothing controls (global stabilization options)  ￼
24.	Pay-once model (no subscription)  ￼
25.	Explicit “no generative AI” stance (a “feature” many artists actively prefer)

# Procreate Clone: Crucial Features (outdated)
(outdated)
Inspired by the Procreate philosophy of "disappearing UI" and "physical learning," these features are the non-negotiable core of the clone. (outdated)

## 1. The Interaction Layer (Gestures)(outdated)
*   **Two-Finger Tap**: Global Undo with haptic/visual feedback.(outdated)
*   **Three-Finger Tap**: Global Redo.(outdated)
*   **Three-Finger Scrub**: Quick-clear active layer.(outdated)
*   **Pinch and Twist**: Zero-latency canvas zoom and rotation.(outdated)
*   **QuickShape (Hold & Snap)**: Draw any line or basic shape (circle, triangle, quad) and hold at the end to snap it into perfect geometric forms.(outdated)

## 2. The Painting Engine(outdated)
*   **Low-Latency Brush Flow**: Continuous 120Hz-240Hz input sampling to ensure strokes follow the stylus without "lag-behind.(outdated)
*   **Dual-Texture Brush Model**: Brushes composed of a **Shape** (the stamp) and a **Grain** (the texture).(outdated)
*   **Stabilization (StreamLine)**: Real-time path smoothing that averages jittery input into professional curves.(outdated)
*   **Alpha Lock**: Restrict drawing to existing pixel boundaries on a layer.(outdated)

## 3. Advanced Selection & Fill(outdated)
*   **ColourDrop & Threshold**: Drag the color circle into an area. Slide left/right while holding to adjust the fill threshold (leak handling).(outdated)
*   **Reference Layers**: Designate a line-art layer as "Reference" so ColourDrop on a different layer respects those boundaries.(outdated)
*   **Lasso Selection**: Freehand selection with instant transformation (Move, Scale, Rotate).      (outdated)

## 4. Minimalist UI (Style-Compliant)(outdated)
*   **Floating Sliders**: Two vertical sliders on the screen edge (Brush Size and Opacity).(outdated)
*   **Hidden Chrome**: Top bar containing only 5-9 high-contrast monochrome icons.(outdated)
*   **Panel Pop-overs**: Brushes, Layers, and Colors open in small non-intrusive pop-overs, not sidebars that resize the canvas.(outdated)

## 5. System Utilities(outdated)
*   **Action-Oriented Undo**: Record high-level actions (strokes) rather than pixel diffs for infinite-style history.(outdated)
*   **Time-lapse Recording**: Silently capture every stroke to export a video of the creative process.(outdated)
*   **3D Painting**: Support for importing `.obj` or `.usdz` models to paint directly on textures.(outdated)
